# Hometown Classifieds
This web application is designed to act as an old style newspaper classifieds ads page for a local community to post and share items that they have for sale. 

## Web Application Features
 - This web app lets users in a local community share items that they have for sale, or respond to users who have an item for sale.
 - All users are brought to a landing page the first time they visit the site where they can sign up for an account. 
 - Once signed in a user can see the main listing page, and choose to see all the posts that other users have submitted by category. 
 - Any listing's title can be clicked on to see that individual posting, and if the user is interested they can get the email of the poster for contact purposes. 
 - The user also has a proflie page where they can manage their own listings. 
 - On the user's profile page they can make new posts, and see all their existing posts, with the ability to delete a post once it is sold.
